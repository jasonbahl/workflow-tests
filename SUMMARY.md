# Summary of Accomplishments

## Node.js Scripts

- Created `generate-changeset.js` for generating changeset files from PR metadata
- Created `generate-release-notes.js` for formatting release notes from changesets
- Created `analyze-changesets.js` for determining version bump type based on changesets
- Created `bump-version.js` for updating version numbers in plugin files
- Created `update-changelog.js` for updating CHANGELOG.md with new entries
- Created `update-readme.js` for updating readme.txt with new entries
- Created `update-changelogs.js` for updating both changelog files at once
- Created `update-upgrade-notice.js` for updating the upgrade notice section in readme.txt
- Created `build.js` for building the plugin for release
- Created utility modules in the `utils` directory:
  - `env.js` for consistent environment variable handling across all scripts

## Workflows

- **generate-changeset.yml**: Automatically generates a changeset file when a PR is merged to develop.
- **release-management.yml**: Handles version bumping, changelog updates, and release creation when changes are merged to main.
  - Now includes improved sync between main and develop branches after releases
    - Uses a non-fast-forward merge strategy with a descriptive commit message
    - Includes [skip ci] in the commit message to prevent triggering additional workflows
    - Ensures version bumps and changelog updates are reflected in both branches
  - Uses temporary directory for release notes to avoid Git tracking issues
  - Implements robust error handling for external service interactions
    - Detects and reports GitHub API rate limiting issues
    - Provides fallback mechanisms when primary methods fail
    - Ensures proper cleanup of temporary resources in all scenarios
- Updated `deploy.yml` for handling deployments:
  - Deploy to WordPress.org SVN
  - Create GitHub release with assets
  - Add release notes to GitHub release

## Documentation

- Updated README.md with comprehensive overview of the project
- Created detailed workflow documentation:
  - Changeset generation process with temporary file handling
  - Release management workflow
  - Deployment process
- Added examples and usage instructions for all scripts
- Documented breaking change detection and handling
- Added information about the new `generate-release-notes.js` script and how to use it locally

## Testing

- Implemented local testing for all scripts
- Created test fixtures for changesets
- Added validation for script inputs
- Ensured scripts can be run both in CI and locally

## Benefits of Our Approach
- **Testability**: All automation logic is in Node.js scripts that can be tested locally
- **Reusability**: Scripts can be used both in CI/CD and by developers locally
- **Maintainability**: Logic is centralized in scripts rather than duplicated in workflow files
- **Flexibility**: Workflows can be customized without changing the core logic
- **Consistency**: Ensures standardized processes for versioning and releases
- **Efficiency**: Combined operations reduce duplication and potential for inconsistencies
- **Cleanliness**: Use of temporary files keeps the repository clean

## Next Steps
- Test scripts with various scenarios to ensure robustness
- Refine based on team feedback
- Migrate to production repositories
- Extend with additional automation scripts
- Improve documentation with examples

## Recent Updates

- **Environment Variables Support**: Added support for environment variables (`REPO_URL` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`) to simplify configuration and usage of the release notes script.
- **Contributor Recognition**: Enhanced release notes to include a contributors section with special recognition for first-time contributors.
- **GitHub Workflow Improvements**: Updated the GitHub workflow to use environment variables instead of command-line arguments, making it cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Temporary File Handling**: Improved the workflow to use temporary files for release notes, keeping the repository clean.
- **Changeset Cleanup**: Changed from archiving changesets to deleting them after a release to prevent duplicate changelog entries.
- **Release Notes Formatting**: Removed unnecessary "Found X changesets" line from release notes.
- **Upgrade Notice Enhancement**: Automatically add breaking changes to the upgrade notice section in readme.txt.
  - The `update-upgrade-notice.js` script checks for breaking changes in the release notes
  - If breaking changes are found, they are added to the upgrade notice section in readme.txt
  - This ensures users are properly warned about potential compatibility issues
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive documentation updates to reflect new features and options.
